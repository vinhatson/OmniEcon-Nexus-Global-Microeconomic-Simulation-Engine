# OmniEcon Nexus: Global Microeconomic Simulation Engine

`OmniEcon Nexus` is an open-source, high-performance simulation engine for global microeconomic and macroeconomic analysis. Built with advanced deep learning, agent-based modeling, and optimization techniques, it enables detailed forecasting, risk analysis, policy generation, and portfolio optimization. This system supports up to 5 million agents and is designed as a comprehensive tool for governments, researchers, and developers to explore economic dynamics.

## Core Features
- **Economic Forecasting**: Predicts short-term and mid-term economic trends using deep learning models.
- **Agent-Based Simulation**: Models up to 5M agents (citizens, businesses, governments) with behavioral psychology.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Optimizes asset allocation using the Sharpe ratio and real-time market data.
- **Policy Generation**: Automatically generates and evaluates macroeconomic policies with Q-learning.
- **Risk Analysis**: Assesses market volatility and systemic risk using network analysis.
- **Market Psychology**: Estimates PMI and agent psychological states (Fear, Greed, Complacency, Hope).

## Technical Overview
### Deep Learning Components
- **MicroEconomicPredictor**: 
  - Architecture: GRU, LSTM, Transformer Encoder, and a custom `QuantumResonanceLayer`.
  - Configuration: Default `hidden_dim=8192`, `num_layers=24`, `input_dim=72`.
  - Purpose: Forecasts short-term (`short_pred`) and mid-term (`mid_pred`) economic growth.
  - Implementation: See `MicroEconomicPredictor.forward()` for details.

- **QuantumResonanceLayer**: 
  - Mechanism: Combines linear transformation with sinusoidal phase shifts and layer normalization.
  - Purpose: Enhances prediction accuracy with quantum-inspired dynamics.

### Agent-Based Modeling
- **HyperAgent**: 
  - Roles: Citizens, businesses, governments.
  - Attributes: Wealth, innovation, trade flow, resilience, psychological state.
  - Behavior: Updated via `interact()`, influenced by market data, global context, and policies.
  - Scale: Supports 5M agents with multiprocessing (`Pool`).

### Optimization and Policy
- **Portfolio Optimization**:
  - Method: Uses `scipy.optimize.minimize` with SLSQP to maximize Sharpe ratio.
  - Inputs: Short-term/mid-term predictions, volatility, crowd sentiment.
  - Constraints: Total weights = 1, stocks + gold ≤ 80%.
  - See: `optimize_portfolio()`.

- **Policy Generation**:
  - Algorithm: Q-learning with state hashing (`generate_policy()`).
  - Inputs: PMI, fear/greed indices, market momentum, volatility.
  - Outputs: Policies like tax reduction, interest rate hikes, subsidies.
  - Evaluation: Assesses impact via `evaluate_policy_impact()` using resilience, cash flow, consumption metrics.

### Network Analysis
- **Systemic Risk Network**:
  - Structure: Directed graph (`networkx.DiGraph`) tracking trade dependencies.
  - Metric: Systemic Risk Score (SRS) via `calculate_systemic_risk_score()` with betweenness centrality.
- **Reflexive Network**:
  - Storage: Policy history in `reflection_network`.
  - Retrieval: ANN-based (`annoy`) policy suggestions in `suggest_reflexive_policy()`.

### Real-Time Data Integration
- **Sources**: 
  - Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`): Market momentum, volatility, commodity prices.
  - Twitter (`tweepy`): Crowd sentiment via hashtag analysis.
  - World Bank (`requests`): Historical GDP, trade, inflation.
- **Fallback**: Simulated data if API keys are unavailable.

## Requirements
- **Python**: 3.8+
- **Libraries**:
  - Core: `numpy`, `cupy`, `pandas`, `torch`, `scipy`, `networkx`
  - Data Access: `yfinance`, `tweepy`, `requests`
  - Modeling: `hmmlearn`, `filterpy`, `scikit-learn`, `annoy`
- **Hardware**: 
  - Minimum: Multi-core CPU, 16GB RAM (small-scale).
  - Recommended: GPU (e.g., NVIDIA A100), 128GB+ RAM, 1TB SSD (5M agents).
- **Installation**:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy cupy-cuda11x pandas torch yfinance hmmlearn scipy networkx tweepy filterpy scikit-learn annoy requests

## 📌 Notes

- The engine performs best with **real-world data** (e.g., national statistics, market feeds).  
- In the absence of raw data, it can simulate behavior using probabilistic assumptions.  
- Architecture is modular, allowing **custom extensions and real-time integrations**.  
- Supports **distributed deployment** on cloud or on-premise environments.
